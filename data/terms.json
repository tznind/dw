    "description":"Losing HP is a general thing, it's getting tired, bruised, cut, and so on. Some wounds are deeper though. These are debilities. \n- Weak (STR): You can't exert much force. Maybe it's just fatigue and injury, or maybe your strength was drained by magic.\n- Shaky (DEX): You're unsteady on your feet and you've got a shake in your hands.\n- Sick (CON): Something just isn't right inside. Maybe you've got a disease or a wasting illness. Maybe you just drank too much ale last night and it's coming back to haunt you.\n- Stunned (INT): That last knock to the head shook something loose. Brain not work so good.\n- Confused (WIS): Ears ringing. Vision blurred. You're more than a little out of it.\n- Scarred (CHA): It may not be permanent, but for now you don't look so good"
